We will look at objects and see what objects are.

{% highlight ruby %}
#=> Self.
{% endhighlight %}

We will look at the magical word self and the current object.

{% highlight ruby %}
#=> Current class.
{% endhighlight %}

For such people, designing a code means and looks like something like this:
